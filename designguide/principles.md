## Principles:

The following guiding principles are based on various established Laws of UX outlined [here](laws-of-ux.md).

- Aesthetics - Not a replacement for good design, but helps compensate for minor flaws. Poor aesthetics can ruin an otherwise well designed functional flow. ([*Aesthetic-Usability Effect*](laws-of-ux.md#aesthetic-usability-effect))

- Avoid providing multiple ways to achieve the same goal within a singular workbench. Providing alternative methods seems like a benefit to the user but requires the user to process/understand why two methods exist and how they may  differ.  
  From [the zen of python]([PEP 20 â€“ The Zen of Python | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)): "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."

- When implementing functionality which is common within other workbenches, a developer should make every effort to ensure behavior of those functions remains consistent with pre-existing implementations.

- Attempt to make user interactions and software responses as fluid and quick as possible. Ideally below 400ms. ([*Doherty threshold*](laws-of-ux.md#doherty-threshold))

- Avoid making interactive elements too small. The size of elements should be large enough to prevent a majority of 'miss-clicks'. ([*Fitts's Law*](laws-of-ux.md#fitts-law))

- Travel distance between functions and related interactive elements should be minimized to reduce incidence of errors. ([*Fitts's Law*](laws-of-ux.md#fitts-law))

- Only expose the most common/likely settings or options a user may need by default. Advanced, or infrequently used controls should be hidden but readily accessible. This minimizes time required to make choices and increases efficiency. ([*Hick-Hyman Law*](laws-of-ux.md#hick-hyman-law))

- Minimize superfluous options in exchange for broadly effective defaults. Advanced preferences shall be accessible via the parameter editor instead of the preferences dialog. ([*Hick-Hyman Law*](laws-of-ux.md#hick-hyman-law))

- When implementing features or functions which are commonly found in other software, one should consider the method by which they function. Deviations from '*reasonably expected behavior*' shall be clearly justified. ([*Jakob's Law*](laws-of-ux.md#jakobs-law))

- Behavior and element use across an application must remain consistent. Deviations shall be clearly justified. ([*Jakob's Law*](laws-of-ux.md#jakobs-law))

- Ensure functions and options are grouped logically and not dispersed randomly. ([*Law of Common Region*](laws-of-ux.md#law-of-common-region))

- Proper organization of like functionality in close proximity together help users understand and organize information better.
  Related elements/functions should share similar visual symbology
  ([*Law of Proximity*](laws-of-ux.md#law-of-proximity) / [*Law of Uniform Connectedness*](laws-of-ux.md#law-of-uniform-connectedness))
