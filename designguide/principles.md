# Principles

The following guiding principles are based on various established [Laws of UX outlined here](./laws-of-ux).

- Aesthetics - Not a replacement for good design, but helps compensate for minor flaws. Poor aesthetics can ruin an otherwise well designed functional flow.\
([*Aesthetic-Usability Effect*](./laws-of-ux.md#aesthetic-usability-effect))

- Avoid providing multiple ways to achieve the same goal within a singular workbench. Providing alternative methods seems like a benefit to the user but requires the user to process/understand why two methods exist and how they may differ.\
"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."\
([The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python))

- When implementing functionality which is common within other workbenches, a developer should make every effort to ensure behavior of those functions remains consistent with pre-existing implementations.

- Attempt to make user interactions and software responses as fluid and quick as possible. Ideally below 400ms.\
([*Doherty threshold*](./laws-of-ux#doherty-threshold))

- Avoid making interactive elements too small. The size of elements should be large enough to prevent a majority of 'miss-clicks'.\
([*Fitts's Law*](./laws-of-ux#fitts-law))

- Travel distance between functions and related interactive elements should be minimized to reduce incidence of errors.\
([*Fitts's Law*](./laws-of-ux#fitts-law))

- Only expose the most common/likely settings or options a user may need by default. Advanced, or infrequently used controls should be hidden but readily accessible. This minimizes time required to make choices and increases efficiency.\
([*Hick-Hyman Law*](./laws-of-ux#hick-hyman-law))

- Minimize superfluous options in exchange for broadly effective defaults. Advanced preferences shall be accessible via the parameter editor instead of the preferences dialog.\
([*Hick-Hyman Law*](./laws-of-ux#hick-hyman-law))

- When implementing features or functions which are commonly found in other software, one should consider the method by which they function. Deviations from '*reasonably expected behavior*' shall be clearly justified.\
([*Jakob's Law*](./laws-of-ux#jakobs-law))

- Behavior and element use across an application must remain consistent. Deviations shall be clearly justified.\
([*Jakob's Law*](./laws-of-ux#jakobs-law))

- Ensure functions and options are grouped logically and not dispersed randomly.\
([*Law of Common Region*](./laws-of-ux#law-of-common-region))

- Proper organization of like functionality in close proximity together help users understand and organize information better.\
Related elements/functions should share similar visual symbology\
([*Law of Proximity*](./laws-of-ux#law-of-proximity) / [*Law of Uniform Connectedness*](./laws-of-ux#law-of-uniform-connectedness))
