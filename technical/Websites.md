# Contributing to FreeCAD websites

Technical information for contributors interested to work on FreeCAD websites.

## The Ecosystem

Currently, the websites infrastructure of FreeCAD consists of the following :

- [The FreeCAD website](https://www.freecad.org) acts as the main entry point into FreeCAD's universe for all users, contributors and interested parties.

- [The News Blog](https://blog.freecad.org/) brings together development news, tutorials and use cases from the community.

- [The Wiki](https://wiki.freecad.org/) gathers all the documentation about FreeCAD, from usage to installation, development, release notes and much more. Historically, this has been the all-purpose place for all FreeCAD-related matters. A more development-oriented portion of it has been migrated to this Developer Handbook.

- [The Developer Handbook](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/) is the very site you are currently in.

- [The Forum](https://forum.freecad.org/) is one of the many places where the community meets and exchanges.

- [The FreeCAD Project Association website](https://fpa.freecad.org/) groups everything that relates to the association overseeing the FreeCAD project.

In addition to the implemented websites listed above, several external platforms are used :

- [The Repositories](https://github.com/FreeCAD) of FreeCAD main codebase, building and packaging, continuous integration, addons, macros, library, websites and more are on GitHub.

- [The Translations](https://crowdin.com/project/freecad) of the software interface and the main website are on Crowdin.

Moreover, here are the current implementation initiatives not yet used :

- [The FreeCAD Documentation](https://freecad-documentation.netlify.app/) overhaul as part of the GSOC 2023
