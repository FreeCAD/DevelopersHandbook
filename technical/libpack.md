# Maintaining the FreeCAD LibPack for Windows

To create a new LibPack for Windows, begin by creating an empty directory. The suggested naming scheme
is to name it "LibPack-XX-YY-ARCH" where XX is the release of FreeCAD the pack is intended to work with,
YY is a version number of the LibPack itself, and ARCH is the architecture the LibPack was build for
(e.g. x86_64 or arm64). The rest of this document will refer to that directory as *LIBPACK*.

Note that in several places below you are instructed to load a developer's power shell: you may use
whichever shell you'd like, but ensure that you are loading the shell configured with the x64 native
compilation tools if you are compiling on an Intel processor. ARM compilation is untested.

In most of the instructions below, code is cloned directly from a first-party git repository. In most
cases it is perfectly feasible to directly download a source release package instead of cloning the
entire git repository.

For the most part, the libraries below are self-compiled in order to reduce dependency on third-party
packagers. In some cases it is feasible to download precompiled binaries of the individual items. Major
exceptions here are that both Python and Qt are used in their precompiled forms since the packages are
provided for Windows by the first parties in each case. libclang is provided by the Qt project as part
of the dependencies of PySide6, but can be self-compiled if desired.

WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Install the following packages into the subdirectory you created for this LibPack. In general the order below should work, with
dependencies being installed before the software which requires them. Note that not all packages use the same installation
structure, so the final LibPack contains several different types of installation tree.
* **[Python](https://python.org)** -- Install in a newly-created *LIBPACK\bin* subdirectory using the basic Python installer. Only install
  Python itself: the Idle IDE, debug symbols, etc. are not included in the LibPack.
* **[Qt](https://qt.io)** -- The Open Source installer is found at https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
* Most of the optional components of Qt can be omitted, except for:
  - Qt WebEngine
  - Qt PDF
  - Qt Image Formats
* Qt should be installed into an arbitrary location outside of the LibPack you are creating: the Qt installer
  will create a subdirectory structure that is based on the version number and architecture of the installation.
  Within that subdirectory are many directories: `bin`,`doc`,`include`, etc. These should all be copied into
  the top level of the LibPack
* **[Boost](https://boost.org)** -- this is split into its headers and libraries:
  - Many Boost libraries are header-only, but FreeCAD does require several compiled libraries
  - Create a file either in your home directory, or in the top level boost src directory, called user-config.jam and
    in it specify the path and version of the Python interpreter installed above. For example:
    ```
    using python : 3.11 : "C:/path/to/libpack/bin" : "C:/path/to/libpack/bin/Include" : "C:/path/to/libpack/bin/libs"  ;
    ```
  - Follow the Boost instructions for compiling: the easiest is to run `bootstrap` from a developer's command prompt
  - Copy the libraries from *BOOST_ROOT\stage\lib* into *LIBPACK\lib*
  - Copy the entire *BOOST_ROOT\boost* directory into *LIBPACK\include*
* **[Coin](https://www.coin3d.org)** -- obtained by cloning and compiling https://github.com/coin3d/coin
  - Make sure you compile against the Boost libraries downloaded above by setting BOOST_ROOT to the top of the *LIBPACK*
  - Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH to the top of the *LIBPACK*
  - Add include directory to find the Boost include files by editing CXXFLAGS and adding "/I C:\path\to\libpack\include" to it
  - Do not build the Tests or Documentation
  - In Visual Studio, run the ALL_BUILD and then INSTALL targets in Release mode, and then again in Debug mode.
* **[Quarter](https://www.coin3d.org)** -- obtained by cloning and compiling https://github.com/coin3d/quarter
  - Set Coin_DIR to *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Coin-4.0.1* (or the current version, if it is not 4.0.1)
  - Set Qt6_DIR to *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Qt6*
  - Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to *LIBPACK*
  - In some cases even with Qt6_DIR specified, Quarter will fail to find all necessary Qt library cmake files. In
    those cases you will need to manually set the path to the cmake files as *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Qt6XXX*.
  - Do not build the examples, tests, or documentation
  - At this time this guide was written, Quarter did not correctly support Qt 6.5: the file QuarterWidgetP.cpp had to
    be modified to add `#include <QOpenGLContext>` in the Qt includes section at the top of the file.
  - Build the ALL_BUILD and INSTALL targets in Release mode
* **[PCRE2](https://pcre.org/)** -- Clone https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2
  - Only required if compiling SWIG, rather than downloading binaries
  - Only shared libraries needed (no need to build static)
* **[SWIG](https://www.swig.org)** -- obtained from https://www.swig.org, prebuilt binaries are available for Windows
  - Copy the downloaded folder to *LIBPACK\bin\swig* (e.g. change its name to remove the version number)
  - Alternative: follow instructions above for PCRE2, then clone from https://github.com/swig/swig.git
  - Note that this will require GNU Bison to build. Windows exe can be downloaded from https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/
* **[Pivy](https://www.coin3d.org)** -- obtained by cloning and compiling https://github.com/coin3d/pivy
  - Set Python_ROOT_DIR to *LIBPACK/bin*
  - Set SWIG_EXECUTABLE to *LIBPACK/bin/swig/swig.exe*
  - Set SWIG_DIR to *LIBPACK/bin/swig/Lib* (note the "Lib" at the end of the path!)
  - Set Coin_DIR to *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Coin-4.0.1* (or the current version, if it is not 4.0.1)
  - NOTE: Do *not* install SoQt -- doing so will trigger a dependency on Qt5
  - Set Qt6_DIR to *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Qt6*
  - In some cases even with Qt6_DIR specified, Quarter will fail to find all necessary Qt library cmake files. In
    those cases you will need to manually set the path to the cmake files as *LIBPACK/lib/cmake/Qt6XXX*.
  - Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to *LIBPACK*
  - Build the ALL_BUILD and INSTALL targets in Release mode

  - E.g. `LIBPACK/bin/python.exe -m pip install pyside6==6.5.2`

    - Run `nmake -f makefile.vc release`
    - Run `nmake -f makefile.vc install INSTALLDIR=C:\path\to\libpack`
* **[OpenCASCADE](https://www.opencascade.org)** -- Also known as OCCT, the core CAD kernel used by FreeCAD is fetched from a gitlab mirror that
  provides additional improvements over the upstream version
  - Clone https://gitlab.com/blobfish/occt
  - Run cMake
  - Enable USE_VTK
  - For each of TCL, TK, VTK, and FreeType (represented below by XXX):

  - Switch to the tag you wish to compile (e.g. `git checkout v6.2.2304`)
  - Run cMake
  - Turn off "Superbuild"
  - Turn off "USE_GUI"
  - Set paths for ZLIB, TCL, and TK

  - Activate MEDFILE_USE_UNICODE
  - The current Medfile CMake scripts assert a dependence on HDF5 v1.10.x -- the error message claims to be
    searching for HDF5 >= 1.10.2, but that is not what is actually implemented, requiring instead *exactly*
    minor version 10. The difference between 1.10 and 1.14 from Medfile's perspective seems to be various calls
    to file information functions, which now require an additional "fields" parameter. Adding `H5O_INFO_ALL` for
    this parameter lets compilation succeed.

  - Open the Visual Studio project in icu4c/source/allinone
  - Configure for your platform and Release, and run Rebuild Solution
  - Copy the contents of *bin64/*, *include/*, and *lib64/* to *LIBPACK/bin/*, *LIBPACK/include/* and *LIBPACK/lib*, respectively.
