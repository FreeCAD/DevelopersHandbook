Technical information for contributors interested to work on FreeCAD Project Association website.

<!-- ## Structure TODO: add more content later -->

## Running locally

To run the FPA website locally, Jekyll, the Ruby static site generator, must be executed on the corresponding folder.\
On a Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux system, Bundler is used :

```
$ sudo apt install ruby-bundler ruby-dev build-essential
$ bundle install
$ cd path/to/your/local/fork/of/the/FPA/website
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open then the link to `127.0.0.1:4000` (or `localhost:4000`) in you web browser.
