# Glossary

Addon:  Additional functionality that can be installed into FreeCAD via the addon manager.  Different types of addons include macros, system macros, workbenches, and other utilities.

Core: [What do we mean by the 'core'?  As in 'core developer' or 'core feature'?   Is it the stuff that is included in the standard binary build?  Stuff that is included in the main src tree?  Stuff other than workbenches?  Stuff written in c++?]


FreeCAD: FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size

Workbench: A conceptual grouping of tools that together are used to achieve a design goal.  For example, the TechDraw workbench is used to produce technical drawings from designs created in other parts of the FreeCAD application.   The Path workbench is used to create toolpaths and generating gcode for cnc machines.
