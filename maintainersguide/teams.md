There are several working groups which assist the maintainers by focusing on key areas. While these groups do not have formal oversight of the FreeCAD code base, the maintainers frequently ask them to review Pull Requests and may defer to the working groups for expert opinion. The working groups are self-governing and generally open to contributors.

## Design Working Group (DWG)
### Mission
The Design Working Group provides comment, review, and feedback for interface changes while working with developers and project maintainers proposing solutions to improve the overall consistency, coherence, and flow of FreeCAD's user experience across all platforms.
### Contact Info
The DWG coordinates and engages in real-time discussions on the FreeCAD Discord server and GitHub.
