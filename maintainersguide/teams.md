There are several working groups that assist the maintainers by focusing on key areas. While these groups do not have formal oversight of the FreeCAD code base, the maintainers frequently ask them to review Pull Requests and may defer to the working groups for expert opinion. The working groups are self-governing and generally open to contributors.
