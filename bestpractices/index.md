# Best Practices

Although this chapter is not FreeCAD specific, it is provided here to help both developers and code reviewers to ensure
clean and easily maintainable code. The practices presented should be treated like food recipes - you can play with them,
alter them - but every change should be thoughtful and intentional.

While this guideline might not be consistently followed throughout all of the existing codebase, adhering to these practices
moving forward will help improve the overall quality of the code and make future contributions more maintainable. Consider it
as inspiration for the better future.

## For Developers
If you are a developer and want to read what we consider as good code please consult practices mentioned below. These guidelines
try to define what the good code is and how it should be written.

- For C++ see [C++ practices](./c++practices.md)
- For Python see [Python practices](./pythonpractices.md)

## For Reviewers
For reviews it is good to have a set of concrete rules that are easy to follow. If you want to learn how to review code, or
simply want to learn how we check code please consult the [reviewer guide](./codereview.md).
